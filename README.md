# Bunny Takeover (practice idle game)

### Story  
There are 7,874,965,825 people in the world and just over 700 million Bunnies. 
Tragedy strikes and the bunny population is all but wiped out. A lone fluffle 
of 500 rabbits remain and decide it's their time to shine. They set to work to
out breed the humans and take over the world.
